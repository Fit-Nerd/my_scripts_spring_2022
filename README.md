# my_scripts_spring_2022
A way to track my progress and build a resume.

Simply a way to put what I've learned from February to current (4/20/22) together. 
To date, I've worked through 1/2 of Headfirst Javascript and The Odin Project foundations course.
But fullstack development didn't feel like the right path.
So, now I've also finished Linux Basics for Hackers and am working on Learn Python 3 The Hard Way.

My first script was a simple way to calculate bmr calories and weight loss macros for an individual. 
I'm excited to create much more.
